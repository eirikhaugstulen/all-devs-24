# Getting Started with the All Devs 24 Template

Welcome to the All Devs 24 Template! This repository is designed for attendees of the All Devs conference to quickly set up their own projects and follow along with the keynotes.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   Start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your application in action.

4. **Explore the Code**:
   Familiarize yourself with the structure of the application. Key components are located in the `components` directory, and the main page is in `app/page.tsx`.

5. **Follow Along**:
   Use this template to prototype and build your own full-stack applications using generative AI techniques discussed in the keynotes.
